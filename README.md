Foodalizr
=========

Welcome to Foodalizr - a really cool web-2.0-ish application.

Installation
-------------

Once you've downloaded the crap, installation is easy:

### a) Check your System Configuration

Before you begin, make sure that your local system is properly configured
for Foodalizr. To do this, execute the following:

    php app/check.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix these now before moving on.

### b) Install the Vendor Libraries

You need to download all of the necessary vendor libraries. Run the following:

    php bin/vendors install

Note that you **must** have git installed and be able to execute the `git`
command to execute this script. If you don't have git available install it.
